# Balancing Bot Pitch – Outline / Cue Sheet

- **The Problem & Background**
  - Old inverted pendulum/red wedge demo was unreliable and hard to replicate.
  - Access to demos limited—shipping/availability issues.
  - High cost, complexity, and expertise required hindered adoption in academic and maker spaces.

- **Our Solution**
  - Workshop-in-a-Box kit (Ruler Kit) as a base: affordable, accessible, and designed for fast setup/adoption.
  - New Balancing Bot module, leveraging modular 3D-printed parts—customizable and easy to source.
  - Python/CircuitPy programming: beginner-friendly and quick to get started.

- **Educational Value**
  - More than just an intro or 'toy'—a hands-on bridge to controls engineering and multidisciplinary learning.
  - Suitable for mechanical, electrical, and software engineering students.
  - Supports curriculum scaling: workshops, advanced coursework, clubs, and research.

- **What Makes It Special**
  - Demonstrates the Ruler kit's (and ecosystem's) power, flexibility, and inspiration potential.
  - Lowers the barrier for students and teachers to build real engineering projects.
  - Opportunity for creativity and expansion beyond 'hello world' projects.

- **Vision**
  - Demo built in under 24 hours—showcases what’s possible with these accessible tools.
  - If we can do this, imagine what educators and students can achieve globally with the same kit/mindset.

- **Next Steps**
  - Record demo & intro videos for academic use.
  - Finalize and share 3D print CAD files.
  - Publish complete build guide with BOM and specifications/links.
  - Add simple Bluetooth communication as a future upgrade.
  - Each step expands utility and removes barriers to entry.

- **Closing / Call to Opportunity**
  - Not just a hackathon project—a vision for getting hands-on engineering into Ambassador & Educator hands!
  - Championing collaboration, accessibility, and inspiring the next generation of inventors.
